# What's got my file?

Upload `final.sh` to github, remember that `final.sh` must print a usage summery if it is not run with the appropriate number of arguments.

Do not upload your script until it is 100% complete and passes all of your personal tests.  This is a verification environment, not a testing environment, if you have questions, please let me know!


## Specifications
"What's got my file?" script. This script takes a file name as an argument and returns the PID of the process and the username of the user who has the file open. I recommend using lsof to accomplish the meat of this task.
